# Exercise: Formatting an HTML page with CSS

## Scenario

An associate of yours is starting a web site that will promote the benefits of children's literature to the parents of young children. It will also provide a list of popular children's books with some related categorical information. He is starting with four books and wants to be able to easily add additional books in the future. He has provided you with the content and information in an HTML file and wants you to organize and showcase the different sections of information so they stand out appropriately. You need to provide sound formatting to all the information in the page so that it displays elements such as headings, paragraph content, and lists in a logical and visually appealing manner.

## Exercise

You have a basic HTML5 web page with the necessary content and information. You need to organize and format it using a combination of internal cascading styles, inline styles, and external style sheet coding.

1. Create separate DIV containers for formatting for each of the following sections:
    - The introduction Children's Literature  section with general information. &#9745;
    - The Classic books available to order  section with the table &#9745;
    - Each of the four Description  sections for each book along with their respective lists of characters &#9745;
2. Apply formatting to the first Children's Literature  Div using inline  styles so that the entire section is surrounded by a light, orange-colored background. &#9745;
3. Apply formatting to the heading in Children's Literature  Div using an internal  style sheet, so that its font color is red  and its font family is Calibri. &#9745;
4. Add an internal  style sheet to format all paragraphs in the document, so that their font color is a shade of blue  and its font family is courier new. &#9745;
5. Add a class  to the paragraph in the Children's Literature  section, so that it can be formatted independently using an internal CSS style to italicize it. The class should be named "variation". &#9745;
6. For Classic books available to order  section, create a DIV ID, so that it can be formatted independently of the other sections with DIVs. Add an internal  style for that DIV ID (called "tablediv"), so that the entire section is surrounded by a blue-colored background. Change the dimensions, so that it surrounds the entire section appropriately. &#9745;
7. Apply formatting to the table in the Classic books available to order  section using an internal style sheet. The table requires a border and the rows need to have alternate colors of 2 shades of yellow (of your choosing). &#9745;
8. Add an internal style sheet to specify the formatting the four remaining DIVs associated with the Description  sections. Each section must be surrounded by a light orange-colored background, the font family must be Arial, and the dimensions should be 900 wide X 220 high. &#9745;
9. Add an internal style sheet for a common nested element in each of the Description sections. Use CSS formatting for nested elements to specify that the header for each of these DIVs should be of a green-shaded color of your choosing. &#9745;
10. Apply formatting to the span of each of the Book titles in the Description  sections. Use an internal style sheet to format the book titles, so that the font family is Helvetica, the color value is #FF0099, and the font weight is bold. &#9745;
11. Create an external style sheet called liststyle.css. Add a link for it in your default.html document. Add code in the external style sheet called liststyle.css to format the Character list elements in each of the Description  sections. The bullets need to be square-shaped and the font size should be 10 points. Also, the individual list elements should be Calibri. &#9745;
12. For the "Click here" link in the very last sentence on the page, add an internal style sheet that makes the background of the link change color when the mouse hovers over it. Make the background color a shade of blue of your choosing.
